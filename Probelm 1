# Problem 1: Dictionaries

> Write a function most_prolific that takes a dict formatted like Beatles_Discography example above and returns the year in which the most albums were released. If you call the function on the Beatles_Discography it should return 1964, which saw more releases than any other year in the discography.
If there are multiple years with the same maximum number of releases, the function should return a list of years.
