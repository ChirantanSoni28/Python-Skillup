# Problem 2: Mutable Datatypes in Dictionaries

    A regular flying circus happens twice or three times a month. For each month, 
    information about the amount of money taken at each event is saved in a list, 
    so that the amounts appear in the order in which they happened. 
    The months' data is all collected in a dictionary called monthly_takings.
    
     Write a function total_takingsthat calculates the sum of takings from every circus in the year
